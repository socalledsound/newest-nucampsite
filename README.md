### notes

need to bring animations into the comments form (in week 3 workshop??)

#

react-animation-components requires 16.0 react
use different library for those animations?

same with
popper 1.3.6
there is a popper 2

#

styling still kind of wonky

#

import images as files in react?

#

<> vs Fragment

#

The biggest changes so far:
movement to features
BrowserRouter in index so Main becomes App

Directory became CampsiteDirectory /features/campsites

are forms components or do they belong in slices?

comments feature, maybe TOO modular?

pages --> features

ErrorMessage

added some selectors
